Internet Gateway (IGW)

Name: cloudlaunch-igw

Attached to cloudlaunch-vpc.

Route Tables

Public Route Table â€“ cloudlaunch-public-rt

Associated with Public Subnet.

Has route 0.0.0.0/0 â†’ cloudlaunch-igw.

Private Route Tables

cloudlaunch-app-rt (App Subnet).

No route to IGW (fully private).

Security Groups

cloudlaunch-app-sg

Allows HTTP (80) traffic within the VPC only.

cloudlaunch-db-sg

Allows MySQL (3306) traffic only from app subnet.

IAM Permissions
